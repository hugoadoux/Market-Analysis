# Market-Analysis

This project intends to anaylize financial markets data in order to later construct an investment strategy that would lead me to beat a DCA approach of investing
I will make several iteration of the same analysis on different indexes (US/Europe/EM)
I want to construct a drop trigger strategy but will update this part later
Simulation will be made to find the best performing combiantion in the past
